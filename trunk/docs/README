podgrabber is a very simple podcast aggregator.  You setup feeds to your
favorite podcasts and let podgrabber go get them.  Plug in your portable audio
device and let it keep you in sync with the latest files you downloaded.  This
software is still beta, but I use it every day, so it is functional.

Add the "src" directory to your PYTHONPATH and then run

python -c "import podgrabber.controller; podgrabber.controller.RSSController().run()"

TODO:
    installer/packaging
    file management through sync tab
    get it working on Windows.
